This example post just shows how to do MDX files with more than just Markdown content with Next.js.

When you are retired, weekends are just like everyone else's weekends. Normal days in the week are all holidays!

```typescript
const sum = (num1: number, num2: number): number => {
  return num1 + num2
}

console.log(sum(4, 8)) // 12
```

## Inform Code Highlighting Test

I doubt this will work properly. Even though highlight.js says it supports Inform7 with either inform7 or i7, I think this is the same highlighter used in Obsidian and therefore it will fail. Unless it is a newer version that does support it?!

```inform7
[Make the player be Alice]
Alice is a woman.
The player is Alice.

[Change to Alan]
Alan is a man in [some location].
Now the player is Alan.
```
