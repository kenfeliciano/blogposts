This example post just shows how to do MDX files with more than just Markdown content with Next.js.

When you are retired, weekends are just like everyone else's weekends. Normal days in the week are all holidays!

```typescript
const sum = (num1: number, num2: number): number => {
  return num1 + num2
}

console.log(sum(4, 8)) // 12
```

## Inform Code Highlighting Test

I doubt this will work properly. Even though highlight.js says it supports Inform7 with either inform7 or i7, I think this is the same highlighter used in Obsidian and therefore it will fail. Unless it is a newer version that does support it?!
Errors galore, removed. Trying again. I think adding `/lib` limited the number of languages.

```javascript
// Was
import rehypeHighlith from 'rehype-highlight/lib'

//Now
import rehypeHighlith from 'rehype-highlight'
```

### The correct solution!

That was not the issue, though I don't see any example of using `rehype-highlight/lib` so I did leave it without. The problem is `rehype-highlight` only loads the core languages from `highlight.js`. Inform7 is not one of those. In order to add that one in there, it requires a couple of things.
A great post by [JonathanMH](https://jonathanmh.com/p/syntax-highlighting-with-mdx-in-next-js/) spells it out perfectly!

```typescript
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight'

// using the first alias in supported languages
import langInform7 from 'highlight.js/lib/languages/inform7'

const languages = {
  inform7: langInform7,
  // If there were more missing, they'd be here
}

const aliases = {
  inform7: 'i7',
  // Same, I didn't actually check to see if this is needed
}

// then later, in mdxOptions...
rehypePlugins: [
  rehypePlugins: [
    [rehypeHighlight, { ignoreMissing: true, // seemed a good idea
    languages,
    aliases
    }],
    //etc...
  ]
]
```

### And the Inform 7 code!

As it doesn't wrap here, but it does wrap in Inform editor, that adds a wrinkle.

```inform7
Before going east to Kitchen for the first time:
	say " As you enter the kitchen, the door slams shut behind you and you
  hear laughter on the other side. You're trapped!";
	now the printed name of Kitchen is "";
	Kname returns in zero turns from now.

At the time when Kname returns:
	now the printed name of Kitchen is "Kitchen".
```

## CSS Code Highlighting

Just seeing if it is something else going on!

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

.prose :where(code):not(:where([class~='not-prose'] *))::before {
  content: '';
}
.prose :where(code):not(:where([class~='not-prose'] *))::after {
  content: '';
}
```
